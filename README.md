# REFLECTIVE ESSAY – Individual – 15% of overall grade


## Background

Reflection is a very important practice that allows us to build on past experiences to identify
areas of strength and opportunities for self- and collective improvement, particularly so in
the context of teamwork. In this assessment, you will reflect individually on your
contribution to the team, what you have learnt in the process of working as part of a group
and suggest venues for improvement for the remainder of the project.


## Task

You need to write a 750 words essay using the 5Rs framework described in the link below:

* https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/60374/pages/6-dot-1-learn-about-reflective-
learning?module_item_id=2430170

The structure below should be followed (create headings in your essay as per below; the
words ‘Step #’ should be omitted):

### Step 1: Reporting

* Based on the feedback you received from your colleagues via the Feedback Fruits
platform, discuss a situation that illustrates what you believe was your main
contribution to the group work leading to the video presentation. Else, elaborate
on a situation that you believe you could have behaved differently but
unfortunately did not have the opportunity to.

### Step 2: Responding

* In relation to the situation reported in the previous step, was there anything specific
that caused you to be vocal (that is, a factor that triggered you to intervene and
express your views) or, else, that you did not feel comfortable participating in (and
hence remained quiet)? What caused that? How would you describe your emotions
in that situation?

### Step 3: Relating

* Discuss the connection between the situation and response you described in Step
2 to any previous experience you had in the past (or any significant factors that
made you behave in the same way – factors either related to the situation itself or
associated with your personality).

### Step 4: Reasoning

* Explain why you chose to deal with the situation reported the way you did. Why
was it important for you to act/behave that way? Why was the situation itself
important?

### Step 5: Reconstructing

* If in the future you were to face the same situation (or a similar one), would you act
in the same way? Why? Did you learn anything working as part of a team for the
video presentation that will change your behaviour in the future? What is
something that you learned that you could apply in the workplace?


## Format

* Font: Calibri
* Font size: 12
* 1.5 line spacing
* Write in the first person (“I did this, I suggested that”)
